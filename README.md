# adaptableblotter
Repository for the Adaptable Blotter HTML5 version, AdaptableBlotter.JS, written by Adaptable Tools.

AdaptableBlotter.JS is a powerful data-agnostic grid that sits on top of an underlying grid component and provides all the rich functionality that financial users expect from their grids and blotters.

It offers - out of the box - incredibly powerful searching, filtering, sorting, styling and editing functionality. And also offers unparalleled validation and audit functions, vital for the current regulatory and compliance environment.

Grid components supported included Telerik's Kendo Grid, the ag-Grid, OpenFin's Hypergrid and the Adaptable Grid by Adaptable Tools.

Licences are free for developers, but an annual end user licence is required for each production user.  Please see the LICENCING file for more information or contact the Adaptable Tools Sales Team.

Further information about AdaptableBlotter.JS, and full Help, is available at www.adaptabletools.com.
